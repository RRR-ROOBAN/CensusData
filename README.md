Project Title: Census Data Standardization and Analysis Pipeline

Description:

The "Census Data Standardization and Analysis Pipeline" is a data engineering project aimed at processing, cleaning, and analyzing census data to generate meaningful insights. The project involves extracting data from MongoDB, transforming it into a standardized format, and storing it in a structured MySQL database. With the MySQL database as the data warehouse, the pipeline enables streamlined analysis and visualization using Python and Streamlit.

Key Components:

Data Extraction: Retrieve raw census data stored in MongoDB, ensuring all records are gathered for further processing.
Data Transformation: Standardize and clean the data by handling missing values, converting data types (such as integers for numerical fields), and applying necessary transformations.
Data Loading: Store the transformed data into a MySQL database, using a dynamic table creation approach to adapt to changing data structures.
Data Analysis: Perform SQL-based analysis on the structured census data, extracting insights such as population trends, demographics, and regional distributions.
Visualization & Reporting: Use Streamlit to build an interactive interface for users to explore data insights visually. Users can run SQL queries and visualize results in real-time, providing a user-friendly way to interact with the data.


Technologies Used:

#MongoDB for storing raw census data.
#MySQL for structured data storage and analysis.
#Python for data extraction, transformation, and interaction with databases.
#Streamlit for building an interactive dashboard for data visualization and user interaction.
#VS Code as the development environment, integrated with Git for version control.
#Objective: The primary goal of this project is to create a robust pipeline for processing census data, making it easier to analyze and gain actionable insights. By standardizing the data and providing a user-
